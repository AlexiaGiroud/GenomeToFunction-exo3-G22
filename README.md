# Genome To Function · Group Exercise 3

**BIO-411 - Group 22**

**Deadline:** 7.12.2025

Check out our GitHub repository here: https://github.com/AlexiaGiroud/GenomeToFunction-exo3-G22.git

Short description
-----------------
Stochastic Gillespie simulations and analysis of promoter bursting (including a 3‑state promoter cycle), together with ODE-based cell‑cycle transcription modeling and harmonic regression of pseudobulk RNA‑seq.

Files of interest
- `Exercise_Week10_11_A_Exercises.ipynb` — Gillespie simulations, promoter-cycle analysis, OFF duration fits, scenario comparisons.
- `Exercise_Week10_11_B_Exercises.ipynb` — ODE simulations for cell-cycle transcription, PCA on pseudobulk RNA-seq, harmonic regression, and downstream analyses.
- `pseudobulk.txt` — Provided processed expression data used in Exercise B.

How to reproduce
- Install required packages (typical):

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```

- Open the notebooks in Jupyter / VS Code and execute the cells in order. Some cells contain interactive widgets — execute them in a Jupyter environment that supports ipywidgets.

The S matrix is a catalog of the reactions. 
Each line is a reaction, each column is a species. 
N : If you increase by 1 it's +1 
G : can switch from 0 to 1. Increase from 0 to 1 -> +1 and if 1 -> 0 it's -1.

Proportion : tau_on / tau_on + tau_off is between 0 and 1
tau_off is the time it takes for the reaction to turn off 
k_off is the time the reaction is off 
tau_off + tau_on is the duration of the cycle

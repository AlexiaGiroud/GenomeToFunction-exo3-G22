    "With εₛ = 0 the transcription rate is constant, so P(t) relaxes to a constant steady state for all parameter values. When εₖ = 0, the degradation rate k(t) is also constant and M(t) simply rises to a constant steady level: no oscillations are present. In contrast, when εₖ > 0, k(t) oscillates periodically while synthesis remains constant. In this case P(t) stays flat, but M(t) shows clear periodic oscillations that follow the oscillations in k(t). This demonstrates that a purely periodic degradation rate is sufficient to generate a periodic mRNA accumulation even when transcription is constant.\n",

    "The PCA performed on the curated list of cell-cycle genes reveals clear cyclic behavior in both the exon and intron datasets, reflecting the periodic transcriptional program of the cell cycle. In the exon-based PCA, the PC1–PC2 projection forms a continuous elliptical trajectory, with samples progressing smoothly as time advances. The two replicates overlap closely, demonstrating good reproducibility. Because exons represent mature mRNA levels, which integrate transcription and decay, the dynamics appear smoother and the phase boundaries slightly less distinct. In contrast, the intron-based PCA displays a sharper and more temporally ordered cyclic structure. Replicates again align well, but early, mid, and late cell-cycle time points separate more clearly along the PCA trajectory. This higher temporal resolution arises because introns capture nascent transcription before RNA processing, resulting in larger oscillation amplitudes and more precisely timed peaks. Overall, both exons and introns encode the same underlying cell-cycle progression, but introns provide a cleaner, more phase-resolved representation, whereas exons present a smoothed version of the same cyclic pattern due to mRNA maturation dynamics.\n"

    "Applying harmonic regression with q‑value and amplitude thresholds allowed the identification of a substantial set of periodically expressed genes among both introns and exons. The resulting peak‑time distributions revealed a pronounced temporal structure, with one group of genes peaking in an earlier window (around 4–8h), consistent with S‑phase transcription, and a larger group peaking later (roughly 12–18h), corresponding to G2/M. The amplitude histograms showed that most selected genes have moderate log₂ peak‑to‑trough values, just above the imposed cutoffs, while only a minority display very strong oscillations. Together, these observations indicate a robust, genome‑wide temporal organization of transcription, with many genes preferentially expressed in late cell‑cycle phases and a secondary, well‑defined cluster of S‑phase genes."

    "By capping inferred mRNA half-lives at 24 hours, the histogram reveals that the majority of cell cycle-regulated transcripts are relatively short-lived, with peak occurrence between 1–4 hours and a sharp drop-off in frequency for longer-lived RNAs. This indicates that cell cycle mRNAs tend to be rapidly degraded, enabling tight control of gene expression timing. We also see a small accumulation at 24 hours corresponding to the imposed upper cap on the inferred half-lives. In the scatter plot of half-life versus mRNA amplitude, high-amplitude transcripts (those showing strong oscillation) are predominantly associated with short half-lives, while longer-lived mRNAs generally exhibit lower peak-to-trough amplitude. The negative relationship suggests that periodic genes driving dynamic cell cycle transitions rely on mRNAs that are quickly turned over—allowing for fast changes in cellular states—while stable mRNAs tend to be less dynamically regulated.\n"

    "The observed relationship between pre-mRNA (intron) and mRNA (exon) peak times, along with the generally short delay between their maxima for most periodic genes, suggests that splicing rates are quite rapid for the majority of cell cycle-regulated transcripts. The fact that many genes show only a brief difference between intron and exon peaks implies efficient processing from pre-mRNA to mature mRNA, enabling fast turnover and tight temporal control of gene expression as required for precise cell cycle progression. However, exceptions do exist: a subset of genes display a longer delay between pre-mRNA and mRNA peaks, indicating those transcripts may undergo slower or regulated splicing, potentially reflecting additional steps in RNA maturation or gene-specific regulatory mechanisms. Overall, most cell cycle genes are characterized by rapid splicing, supporting the dynamic changes in transcript levels observed during cell cycle transitions."

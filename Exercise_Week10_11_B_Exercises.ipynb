    "The PCA of the curated list of cell-cycle genes shows a clear and reproducible cyclic structure, both for exons and introns.\n",
    "For the exons, the PC1–PC2 projection forms a continuous elliptical trajectory in which samples gradually arrange themselves throughout the cell cycle. A high level of reproducibility is observed, as the two replicates overlap well. Early time points cluster together, and the trajectory then evolves smoothly, reflecting the activation of S-phase genes followed by mitotic genes. Because exons originate from mature mRNA, the observed dynamics are more smoothed, which dampens rapid variations in transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "For introns, the PCA displays a similar trajectory but one that is sharper and more temporally ordered, and the replicates again overlap very well. This is because introns capture transcriptional activity in real time (before mRNA maturation), so the different phases of the cell cycle are more clearly resolved in the PCA. Early, intermediate, and late points are more distinct, and the temporal progression along the ellipse is more monotonic and better defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the intron-based PCA provides a more precise temporal ordering, whereas the exon-based PCA shows a slightly shifted and more smoothed version of the same dynamics. As mentioned, these differences arise from the time required for mRNA maturation."

    "##### Answer 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the gene expression time-course and PCA plots of curated cell cycle genes, we can estimate when the key cell cycle transitions occur. The G₁/S transition, marking the onset of DNA replication, is indicated by sharp increases in the expression of genes such as PCNA, CDK2, and MCM2—these peaks occur around 6–8 hours after synchronization, consistent with a commitment to S phase reported in the literature. On the PCA plots, this transition aligns with an inflection where samples move from the early part of the elliptical trajectory toward the region where S-phase genes rise, reflecting the shift in global gene expression. The G₂/M transition is marked by a rapid rise in expression of mitotic genes like CCNB1, PLK1, and AURKA, which reach their peaks around 15–17 hours. This phase is also represented as another turn along the PCA trajectory, where the trajectory turns into the region where mitotic genes reach peak expression, reflecting preparation for mitosis. The intron-based PCA gives the most relevant of transitions, since introns illustrate transcriptional activation more directly, while exons are slightly delayed due to mRNA processing. In both PCA plots, samples follow a smooth elliptical trajectory characteristic of periodic cell-cycle transcription. Thus, inspection of both the gene-level profiles and the global patterns in PCA allows us to estimate that G₁/S and G₂/M transitions occur at approximately 6–8 hours and 15–17 hours, respectively.\n",

    "Applying q-value and amplitude thresholds allows the selection of genes displaying robust periodic behavior throughout the cell cycle. In total, we identify 1233 periodic intron genes and 3016 periodic exon genes, a difference that is consistent with the higher sensitivity of introns for detecting real-time transcriptional activity. Histograms of peak times (phases) reveal a clear temporal structure. Two major groups appear: a first cluster around 6–10 hours, corresponding to S-phase transcription, and a second, larger cluster between 12 and 18 hours, corresponding to late cell-cycle phases such as G2 and M. This indicates that a substantial fraction of cell-cycle-regulated genes reaches maximum expression during mitosis, while S-phase genes form a smaller but distinct group. Amplitude distributions show that most selected genes exhibit moderate log₂ peak-to-trough values, with only a minority displaying very strong rhythmicity. Together, these results reveal a strong temporal organization of periodic transcription, with an enrichment of genes expressed in late phases and a secondary cluster specific to S-phase."

    "The scatter plot comparing mRNA (exon) and pre-mRNA (intron) peak times reveals a strong positive relationship for genes that are periodic at both levels. Most data points closely follow the identity line, indicating that for the majority of genes, the timing of peak expression for pre-mRNA and mature mRNA is similar. However, a consistent trend is observed where many genes have intron peaks occurring slightly earlier than their exon peaks, which is biologically expected since precursor transcripts (pre-mRNA) are processed before accumulating as mature mRNA. This modest time lag between intron and exon peaks reflects the kinetics of transcription and mRNA processing in the cell, with the difference providing insight into the dynamics of gene regulation during the cell cycle. The overall tight distribution around the diagonal also suggests that, for most periodic genes, transcriptional activation and mRNA accumulation are closely coupled in time across the cell cycle phases."

    "By capping inferred mRNA half-lives at 24 hours, the histogram reveals that the majority of cell cycle-regulated transcripts are relatively short-lived, with peak occurrence between 1–4 hours and a sharp drop-off in frequency for longer-lived RNAs. This indicates that cell cycle mRNAs tend to be rapidly degraded, enabling tight control of gene expression timing. We also see a small accumulation at 24 hours corresponding to the imposed upper cap on the inferred half-lives. In the scatter plot of half-life versus mRNA amplitude, high-amplitude transcripts (those showing strong oscillation) are predominantly associated with short half-lives, while longer-lived mRNAs generally exhibit lower peak-to-trough amplitude. The negative relationship suggests that periodic genes driving dynamic cell cycle transitions rely on mRNAs that are quickly turned over—allowing for fast changes in cellular states—while stable mRNAs tend to be less dynamically regulated.\n"

    "The observed relationship between pre-mRNA (intron) and mRNA (exon) peak times, along with the generally short delay between their maxima for most periodic genes, suggests that splicing rates are quite rapid for the majority of cell cycle-regulated transcripts. The fact that many genes show only a brief difference between intron and exon peaks implies efficient processing from pre-mRNA to mature mRNA, enabling fast turnover and tight temporal control of gene expression as required for precise cell cycle progression. However, exceptions do exist: a subset of genes display a longer delay between pre-mRNA and mRNA peaks, indicating those transcripts may undergo slower or regulated splicing, potentially reflecting additional steps in RNA maturation or gene-specific regulatory mechanisms. Overall, most cell cycle genes are characterized by rapid splicing, supporting the dynamic changes in transcript levels observed during cell cycle transitions."

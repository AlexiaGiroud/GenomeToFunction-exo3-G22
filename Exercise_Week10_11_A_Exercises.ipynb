Let’s say that you also aim to minimize the variance, which scenario is better?

For example with two $OFF$ states, it would look like: $ON\\,(g=1)\\longrightarrow OFF_1 (g=2) \\longrightarrow OFF_2 (g=3) \\longrightarrow ON (g=1)$. This is related to the fact that transcription events often show a refractory period, *i.e.* promoter tend to say off for some amount of time before turning back on. \n",

Show some representative simulations. Plot both the mRNA and promoter state and comment.\n",
